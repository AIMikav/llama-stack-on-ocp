        "# Level 4: Agentic & MCP (Medium Difficulty)\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial is aimed at those already familiar with basic Agentic workflows. It is meant to showcase  **sequential tool calls** or **conditional logic** within the context of an agentic workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial we will be connecting to a llama-stack instance, building an agent with various tools available to it, and inferencing against the agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "\n",
        "Before starting, ensure you have the following:\n",
        "- Access to an openshift cluster with A deployment of the [openshift MCP server](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/llama-stack-on-ocp/tree/main/mcp-servers/openshift) (see the [deployment manifests](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/llama-stack-on-ocp/tree/main/kubernetes/mcp-servers/openshift-mcp) for assistance with this).\n",
        "- User variables configured (see section `Setting your ENV variables` below).\n",
        "- A Tavily API key is required. You can register for one at https://tavily.com/home.\n",
        "\n",
        "## General Setup - Agnostic to all Queries\n",
        "\n",
        "These steps will be the same for all 3 queries, with the exception of inputing the Tavily API key - this will only be used for query 2, and so could be ommitted if one only wants to run demos 1 or 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Setting your ENV variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "As mentioned above, for this demo there are a few ENV variables that need to set:\n",
        "- `REMOTE` (boolean): dictates if you are using a remote llama-stack instance.\n",
        "- `REMOTE_BASE_URL` (string): the URL for your llama-stack instance if using remote connection.\n",
        "- `TAVILY_SEARCH_API_KEY` (string): your API key for tavily search. One can get one by going to: https://tavily.com/home.\n",
        "- `REMOTE_OCP_MCP_URL` (string): the URL for your Openshift MCP server. If the client does not find the tool registered to the llama-stack instance, it will use this URL to register the Openshift tool (used in demos 1 and 3).\n",
        "- `USE_PROMPT_CHAINING` (boolean): dictates if the prompt should be formatted as 3 separate prompts to isolate the steps. This is an option because a single inference call is able to do the search and draft the email, but by destructuring this into sub-steps where the LLM can focus on a single task at a time can theoretically increase performance. Additionally while this task can be accomplished from a single prompt, other more complex questions may not be doable in this way. This prompt-chaining example is meant to demonstrate how one might do this.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Installing dependencies\n",
